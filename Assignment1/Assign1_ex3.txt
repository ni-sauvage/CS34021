The three main components of computer architecture are:
1) Instruction set architecture. This is what instructions your machine is capable of performing. For example, a theoretical ISA might not have implemented any shift operations, due to architecture limitations. 
2) Microarchitecture. This is the components that make up your processor and memory, e.g. How many registers, if there is a floating point unit, the bus size between registers and memory.
3) Hardware. This is the physical specifics of a Microarchitecture, e.g. distance between components of a microarchitecture, such as ALU and registers and the clock rates of the components.
